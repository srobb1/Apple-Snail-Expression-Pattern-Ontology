def: "A type of experimental evidence that is based on characterization of gene expression." [ECO:MCC, GO:IEP]
comment: Use this evidence type when the annotation is inferred from the timing or location of expression of a gene. It may be difficult to determine whether the expression pattern truly indicates that a gene plays a role in a given process.

def: "An assertion method that does not involve human review." [ECO:MCC]
comment: An automatic assertion is based on computationally generated information that is not reviewed by a person prior to making the assertion. For example, one common type of automatic assertion involves creating an association of evidence with an entity based on commonness of attributes of that entity and another entity for which an assertion already exists. The commonness is determined algorithmically.
